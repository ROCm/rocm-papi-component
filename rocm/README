ROCM component update: Support for ROCM metrics


Known problems and limitations in early release of metric support
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* Only sets of metrics and events that can be gathered in a single
  pass are supported.  Transparent multi-pass support is expected
* All metrics are returned as long long integers


General information
-------------------

The PAPI ROCM component is a hardware performance counter
measurement technology for the AMD ROCM platform which provides
access to the hardware counters inside the GPU. The component is
an adapter fo ROCm profiling library (RPL, 'ROC-profiler') which
is included in standard ROCM release.


How to install PAPI with the ROCM component?
-------------------------------------------- 

This PAPI ROCm componen has been developed and tested using ROCM
release 1.8.

This component uses the ROCM location from the environment (or looks
for /opt/rocm by default). Please set ROCM_DIR and RPL_DIR during
builds so that the component can find the required header files.

Configure PAPI with ROCM enabled.  
    % cd src
    % ./configure --prefix=some_location --with-components="rocm"

Build with ROCM_DIR and RPL_DIR specified
    % export ROCM_DIR=/opt/rocm
    % export RPL_DIR=/opt/rocm/rocprofiler
    % make 

To find a list of ROCM supported events.
    % utils/papi_native_avail | grep rocm
